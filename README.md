This repository contains my research project on autonomous driving for small RC-vehicles.

## Object Detection (*done)

Yolov3 is used to detect the cups which represent the waypoints.

## World Transform (*done)

The detected cups (in the picture) are projected onto a two dimensional plane to obtains the world coordinates.

## Hobby Algorithm (*in progress)

The Hobby Algorithm [[1]](#1) will be used to interpolate the single waypoints.

This video (german) provides a good starting point: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrjdI3x3PYQ
